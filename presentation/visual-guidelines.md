# Visual Guidelines for AI Mythbusters Presentation

**Purpose:** Ensure consistent, professional, high-impact visual design across all slides
**Style:** Steve Jobs minimalist - maximum impact with minimum clutter
**Platform:** Gamma (or PowerPoint/Keynote as fallback)

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. One Idea Per Slide
- Each slide communicates exactly one concept
- If you're tempted to add "and also..." - make a new slide
- Ruthlessly eliminate secondary information

### 2. Maximum Legibility
- **10-foot rule:** If you can't read it from 10 feet away from your laptop, it's too small
- **Back-of-room test:** Someone in the last row should read every word clearly
- **High contrast:** Text must be readable even with poor projector quality

### 3. Visuals Support, Never Decorate
- Every image must reinforce the message
- Remove any visual that's "just for looks"
- If the slide works without the image, you don't need the image

### 4. Consistency Over Creativity
- Same fonts throughout
- Same color palette throughout
- Same visual style throughout
- Consistency = professionalism

---

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors

**Deep Blue** `#1E3A8A`
- Use for: Main headings, trust elements, professional contexts
- Psychology: Authority, reliability, intelligence
- Example usage: Myth slide headings, section dividers

**Electric Orange** `#FF6B35`
- Use for: Accent elements, warnings, myth labels
- Psychology: Energy, attention, caution
- Example usage: "Myth #X" labels, important callouts

### Supporting Colors

**Success Green** `#00AA00`
- Use for: Correct answers, positive actions, checkmarks
- Example usage: "Actually: 3" on strawberry slide, checklist items

**Error Red** `#FF4444`
- Use for: Wrong answers, warnings, mistakes
- Example usage: "AI says: 2" on strawberry slide, "Never do this" slide

**Neutral Gray** `#374151` (Charcoal)
- Use for: Body text, secondary information
- Never use pure black (#000000) - too harsh on eyes

**Light Background** `#F9FAFB` (Almost White)
- Use for: Slide backgrounds (slightly easier on eyes than pure white)
- Can alternate with pure white for variety

### Color Usage Rules

- **Maximum 3 colors per slide** (excluding black/white/gray)
- **Never use color as the only differentiator** (accessibility - also use icons, size, position)
- **Test on projector before final presentation** (colors appear different on screen vs projection)

---

## Typography

### Font Selection

**Primary Font:** Helvetica Neue (or Calibri if unavailable)
- Clean, modern, professional
- Excellent readability at all sizes
- Widely available

**Alternative Fonts:**
- **Sans-serif only** (no Times New Roman or serif fonts)
- Acceptable alternatives: Arial, Open Sans, Roboto, SF Pro
- **Never mix multiple fonts** - pick one and stick with it

### Font Sizes

**Headers (Slide Titles):**
- Minimum: 60pt
- Recommended: 72pt
- Maximum: 120pt (for single-word impact slides)
- **Bold weight**

**Body Text:**
- Minimum: 36pt
- Recommended: 42pt
- Never go below 36pt for any reason

**Sub-text / Explanatory Text:**
- Minimum: 32pt
- Recommended: 36pt
- Maximum: 3 lines of sub-text per slide

**Small Text (contact info, sources):**
- Minimum: 24pt
- Use sparingly, bottom of slide only
- Gray color to de-emphasize

### Typography Rules

- **Bold for emphasis** - never underline, never all-caps (except very short 1-2 word headers)
- **Line spacing:** 1.5x minimum (improves readability)
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned for paragraphs, centered for single lines
- **Maximum text per slide:** 30 words (ideally under 20)

## Animation Guidelines

### When to Use Animation

**Strategic Builds (DO):**
- Revealing unexpected information (strawberry answer)
- Progressive disclosure (checklist items)
- Dramatic reveals (iceberg underwater)
- Emphasizing sequence (first, second, third)

**Avoid (DON'T):**
- Slide transitions (distracting, dated)
- Bullet point builds without purpose
- Spinning, flying, or bouncing text
- Sound effects
- Automatic animations (you control pacing, not the slide)

### Animation Specifications

**Timing:**
- Fade in: 0.3-0.5 seconds (quick but not jarring)
- Dramatic reveal: 0.8-1.2 seconds (iceberg, strawberry)
- Never slower than 1.5 seconds (audience gets impatient)

**Effects:**
- Fade: Most professional, least distracting
- Wipe: Acceptable for dramatic reveals
- Avoid: Zoom, rotate, bounce, fly-in

**Control:**
- Click-triggered (never automatic)
- You control pacing based on audience reaction
- Practice timing during rehearsal

---

## Accessibility Considerations

### Color Blindness
- Never use color alone to convey meaning
- Always pair color with icons, text, or position
- Red/green: Also use X/checkmark icons
- Test slides with color blindness simulator

### Readability
- High contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum: 4.5:1)
- No light gray text on white background
- No text over busy photos (use overlay/shadow)

### Font Weight
- Never use font weight lighter than "Regular"
- Bold for headers and emphasis only
- No light or thin weights (invisible on projector)

---

## Technical Specifications

### Slide Dimensions
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 (standard)
- **Resolution:** 1920×1080 minimum
- **Safe area:** Keep text 10% away from edges

### File Format
- **Gamma:** Native .gamma file
- **Backup:** Export PDF (for compatibility)
- **Print version:** Separate file (higher contrast for print)

### Fonts
- **Embed fonts** in file (ensures consistency across systems)
- Test on actual presentation computer
- Bring backup USB with fonts installed

### File Size
- Optimize images (no need for 10MB photos)
- Target: Under 50MB total presentation file
- Test load time on actual presentation system

## Final Review Questions

Before finalizing slides, ask yourself:

1. **Legibility:** Can I read every word from 10 feet away?
2. **Simplicity:** Does each slide have exactly one idea?
3. **Impact:** Would I remember this visual one week later?
4. **Consistency:** Does this match the rest of the deck?
5. **Purpose:** Does this visual support or distract from the message?
6. **Accessibility:** Can everyone in the audience engage with this?

If any answer is "no," revise the slide.
