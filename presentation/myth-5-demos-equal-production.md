## SLIDE 18: The Myth

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Full-screen visual with text overlay
- **Background:** Speedometer maxed out at redline, needle at maximum
- **Color scheme:** Red/orange (danger, speed)
- **Visual effects:** Motion blur, speed lines
- **Text:**
  - Top: "Myth #5" (36pt, white)
  - Center: "MVP in 2 Hours!" (84pt, bold, white, exclamation point critical)

### Speaker Script

**[Advance to slide]**

"Myth number five."

**[Let speedometer visual register]**

"MVP in 2 hours!"

**[Pause, shift tone - this is exciting but...]**

"This one's seductive."

**[Step forward slightly, more intimate tone]**

"I've watched developers build working web apps in TWO HOURS using AI."

**[Gesture broadly]**

"Not wireframes. Not mockups. Actual functioning applications."

**[Enumerate with fingers]**

"Users can sign up.
Create content.
Share it.
Comment."

**[Amazed tone]**

"Database. Authentication. Professional design."

**[Pause]**

"Two. Hours."

**[Shift tone - serious now]**

"It's incredible."

**[Pause, direct eye contact]**

"And it's **misleading**."

**[Click to next slide]**

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 50-60 seconds
- **Key pauses:**
  - After "Two. Hours.": 2 seconds (let absurdity sink in)
  - After "And it's misleading": 2-3 seconds (tone shift moment)

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone journey:** Excitement → amazement → caution
- **Contrast:** Build up how impressive it is, THEN reveal the problem
- **Believability:** Don't dismiss the achievement - it IS real, it's just not what it seems

## SLIDE 19: The Reality

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Iceberg diagram (most important visual of presentation)
- **Background:** Ocean blue gradient

**Iceberg Visualization:**

**Part 1 (initial state - before build):**
- Small iceberg tip above water
- Label: "MVP Demo" (36pt, on the tip)
- Clean, simple shape
- Waterline clearly visible

**Part 2 (after click - dramatic reveal):**
- MASSIVE underwater portion fades in (2-3x size of tip)
- Multiple labels on underwater portion (stack vertically):
  - Error handling
  - Edge cases
  - Performance
  - Security
  - Integration
  - Monitoring
  - Documentation
  - Scalability

**Text overlay:**
- Top: "Reality: 80% of Work Remains" (60pt, white, bold)
- Bottom: "What you see ≠ What you need" (36pt, white)

**Animation:**
- Click 1: Underwater portion fades in over 1 second
- Visual impact: The underwater mass should dwarf the visible tip

### Speaker Script

**[Slide advances - just tip visible]**

"Reality: 80% of the work remains."

**[Point to small tip]**

"Here's what you see in the demo. The MVP. The working prototype."

**[Pause]**

"Looks complete, right?"

**[Click - massive underwater portion reveals]**

**[Let visual impact land - stay quiet for 3-4 seconds]**

**[Point to underwater portion, tone becomes serious]**

"Here's what's missing."

**[Read labels, building gravity]**

"Error handling - what happens when things go wrong.

Edge cases - what happens when users do unexpected things.

Performance - what happens under real-world load.

Security - what happens when bad actors attack.

Integration - connecting to your actual systems.

Monitoring - knowing when things break in production.

Documentation - so the next developer can understand it.

Scalability - handling 1000x more users."

**[Pause, let the list sink in]**

**[Direct, matter-of-fact]**

"All of that?"

**[Point to underwater mass]**

"Invisible in the demo."

**[Point to tip]**

"This is 20% of the work."

**[Point to underwater]**

"This is 80%."

**[Pause, serious]**

"The demo is the easy part."

**[Click to next slide]**

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 90-100 seconds
- **Critical pauses:**
  - After reveal (before speaking): 3-4 seconds (let visual impact land)
  - After reading all missing items: 2-3 seconds
  - After "The demo is the easy part": 2 seconds

### Delivery Notes
- **The reveal:** This is the "one more thing..." moment - underwater portion should shock
- **Silence:** After reveal, let them SEE it before you explain
- **Pacing:** Read the missing items steadily, building weight
- **Gravity:** This is the most serious moment in presentation - match tone
- **Physical:** Point at iceberg parts to emphasize above/below divide

## SLIDE 20: So What

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Timeline comparison
- **Background:** White/light gray
- **Title:** "Budget for Refactoring" (60pt, bold, blue, top)

**Visual:** Two timelines side-by-side

**Timeline 1 - "The Expectation":**
- Labeled boxes:
  - MVP Demo: 2 hours
  - Production: 2 hours
  - **Total: 4 hours** ✓
- Visual: Small, compact timeline

**Timeline 2 - "The Reality":**
- Labeled boxes:
  - MVP Demo: 2 hours
  - Production: 20+ hours
  - **Total: 22+ hours**
- Visual: Much longer timeline (4-5x the expected)
- Arrow showing the gap

**Multiplier callout:** "Budget 4-10x demo time for production"

### Speaker Script

**[Slide advances]**

"So what do you do about this?"

**[Point to expectation timeline]**

"Don't believe this."

**[Read it]**

"'We built the demo in 2 hours, so production will take 2 more hours. We'll ship next week!'"

**[Shake head]**

"No."

**[Point to reality timeline]**

"This is reality."

**[Read the numbers]**

"Demo: 2 hours.
Production-ready: 20+ hours."

**[Pause, let math land]**

**[Direct to executives]**

"If someone shows you an AI-built demo and says 'we're almost done'..."

**[Gesture: multiply]**

"...multiply their timeline by **10**."

**[Serious, protecting them from mistake]**

"That's your realistic production budget."

**[Pause]**

**[Shift to when it DOES make sense]**

"Now - does this mean don't use AI for coding?"

**[Shake head]**

"No. It means use it for the right things."

**[Enumerate clearly]**

"Prototypes to test ideas? Perfect.
Internal tools for your team? Great.
Learning and experimentation? Absolutely."

**[Contrast]**

"Customer-facing applications?
Revenue-critical systems?
Long-term maintained software?"

**[Serious]**

"Budget properly. Or rebuild later."

**[Pause]**

**[Lighter, transitioning out of myths]**

"Okay. We've busted five myths."

**[Gesture wrapping up]**

"You now know:
AI completes patterns.
It augments, doesn't replace.
It hallucinates.
Good prompts matter.
Demos aren't products."

**[Shift energy - action mode]**

"So what do you actually **DO** with all this?"

**[Pause]**

"Let's talk about your action plan."

**[Click to next section - Act 3]**

---

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 90-100 seconds
- **Key pauses:**
  - After "multiply by 10": 2-3 seconds (let the number land)
  - After listing customer-facing/revenue-critical: 2 seconds (gravity)
  - After recap of all myths: 2 seconds (transition moment)

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone:** Protective → practical → transitional
- **"Multiply by 10":** Say this clearly, it's the takeaway number
- **When it works:** Balance the caution with legitimate uses
- **Transition:** Shift energy up for action plan (myths were educational, now practical)
- **Recap:** Quick summary of all 5 myths ties section together

---

## Section Wrap-Up: The Danger Myth

**Purpose of Myth #5:**
- Reveals hidden complexity (iceberg visual is memorable)
- Protects from timeline disasters (10x multiplier)
- Balances enthusiasm with realism
- Completes the myth-busting framework

**Energy Check:** By end of this section, audience should:
- ✓ Remember iceberg visual (20% visible, 80% underwater)
- ✓ Know the 4-10x multiplier for production
- ✓ Understand when vibe coding makes sense
- ✓ Be ready for action plan (educated, not scared)

**Transition:** All 5 myths busted. Now pivot to "What do we DO?" (Act 3 - action plan).

## Adaptation Notes

### For Technical Audience
Add specific examples:
"That 80% includes: database migrations, API rate limiting, CI/CD pipelines, error logging, security audits, load testing, accessibility compliance, browser compatibility..."

### For Non-Technical Executives
Simplify to business impact:
"In business terms: The demo gets you a proof of concept. The underwater work gets you a product you can actually sell and support at scale."

### For Risk-Averse Audience
Emphasize consequences:
"I've seen companies ship AI demos to production. Security breaches in week one. Data loss in week two. Complete rebuild in month two. The hidden costs are real."

### For Time-Constrained Version
- Slide 18: 20 seconds
- Slide 19: 50 seconds (iceberg reveal, skip detailed list)
- Slide 20: 30 seconds (show timelines, skip extended explanation)

## Visual Asset Requirements

### Slide 19 Iceberg - Critical Specifications

This is the most important visual in the presentation. Requirements:

**Proportions:**
- Tip (above water): 20% of total mass
- Underwater: 80% of total mass
- Make the difference DRAMATIC - audience should gasp

**Colors:**
- Tip: Light blue, bright (hopeful, visible)
- Underwater: Darker blue, ominous (hidden, massive)
- Water surface: Clear line separating worlds

**Labels:**
- Tip: Single label "MVP Demo" (large, clear)
- Underwater: 8 labels stacked vertically (readable but crowded - showing complexity)

**Animation:**
- Initial: Just tip visible, calm water
- Build: Underwater mass fades in (1 second, smooth)
- Impact: Size difference should be shocking

**Test:** Show to someone unfamiliar - do they immediately understand "way more work than visible"?
