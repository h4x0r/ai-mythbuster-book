# Presentation Script: Myth #3 - "AI Is Always Right"

**Section Duration:** 5-6 minutes
**Slides:** 12, 13, 14 (Myth → Reality → So What pattern)
**Energy Level:** Building to reveal moment on Slide 13
**Audience Interaction:** Live demonstration encouraged

---

## SLIDE 12: The Myth

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Full-screen visual with text overlay
- **Background:** Confident-looking humanoid robot, arms crossed, slight glow effect
- **Color scheme:** Cool blues and silvers (conveys "technological authority")
- **Text:**
  - Top: "Myth #3" (small, white text)
  - Center: "Trust AI Completely" (large, bold, white text)
- **Animation:** None (static impact)

### Speaker Script

**[Advance to slide, pause 2 seconds for visual to register]**

"Myth #3. Trust AI completely."

**[Pause, make eye contact with audience]**

"AI sounds confident, doesn't it? Authoritative, even."

**[Gesture toward screen]**

"When ChatGPT answers a question, it doesn't hedge. It doesn't say 'I think' or 'maybe.' It just... tells you. With complete certainty."

**[Shift tone slightly, more conversational]**

"So it must be right. Yeah?"

**[Beat. Let the question hang.]**

**[Click to next slide]**

---

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 30-40 seconds
- **Key pause:** After "So it must be right. Yeah?" - make eye contact, let skepticism build
- **Transition cue:** Click on "Yeah?" to create immediate contrast with next slide

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone:** Start neutral, build to slightly skeptical on final question
- **Physicality:** Open stance, gesture to robot when mentioning confidence
- **Eye contact:** Scan audience during pauses - you want them questioning before the reveal
- **Avoid:** Don't give away the answer with your tone - play it straight until the reveal

## SLIDE 13: The Reality

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Build sequence (two-part reveal)
- **Background:** Clean white with single word centered

**Part 1 (initial state):**
- **Center:** The word "strawberry" in large, clean sans-serif font (120pt)
- **Bottom:** Question text: "How many times does the letter 'r' appear?" (36pt, gray)

**Part 2 (after first click - build animation):**
- **Center:** Same "strawberry" but with R's highlighted in red:
  - st**R**awbe**RR**y (3 R's glowing/highlighted)
- **Below word:** AI's answer appears: "AI says: 2" (48pt, orange - error color)
- **Below AI answer:** Correct answer appears: "Actually: 3" (48pt, green - correct color)

**Animation timing:**
- Click 1: Highlights appear on R's (0.5 second fade-in)
- Click 2: "AI says: 2" appears (0.3 second fade-in)
- Click 3: "Actually: 3" appears (0.3 second fade-in)

### Speaker Script

**[Slide advances to Part 1 - just the word and question]**

"Let me show you something."

**[Read the question aloud, pointing at screen]**

"How many times does the letter 'r' appear in the word 'strawberry'?"

**[Pause, look at audience]**

"Take a second. Count them."

**[Wait 3-4 seconds - let audience actually count]**

**[Click - highlights appear on the R's]**

"Let's see. S-T-**R**-A-W-B-E-**R-R**-Y."

**[Count with finger while pointing]**

"One. Two. Three."

**[Pause for effect]**

"Three R's. Pretty straightforward, right?"

**[Click - "AI says: 2" appears]**

**[Tone shift - almost amused]**

"Ask ChatGPT right now - go ahead, I'll wait - and it will tell you there are **two** R's in strawberry."

**[Pause while audience reacts - you'll usually get murmurs, laughs, or people pulling out phones]**

**[Click - "Actually: 3" appears for emphasis]**

"Not three. **Two**."

**[Shake head slightly, half-smile]**

"It's counting letters. In a single word. How hard can that be?"

**[Pause, let it land]**

**[More serious tone now]**

"But here's the thing that should worry you..."

**[Lean forward slightly, emphasis]**

"The AI doesn't say 'I'm not sure' or 'I might be wrong.' It answers with the **same confidence** it would use to quote Shakespeare or explain photosynthesis."

**[Pause]**

"Confidence is not correctness."

**[Beat]**

**[Click to next slide]**

---

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 90-120 seconds
- **Key pauses:**
  - After asking question: 3-4 seconds (let them count)
  - After reveal of "AI says 2": Let audience react naturally (5-10 seconds)
  - After "Confidence is not correctness": 2-3 seconds (let it sink in)
- **Interaction window:** 5-10 seconds after "AI says: 2" for audience reaction

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone journey:** Casual → curious → amused → serious
- **Physicality:**
  - Point at screen when counting R's
  - Step slightly back when revealing AI's wrong answer (create space for audience reaction)
  - Lean forward on "Confidence is not correctness" (emphasis)
- **Audience interaction:**
  - If people pull out phones to test (they often do): "Yeah, try it! I promise I'm not making this up."
  - If someone calls out "It got it right!": "Interesting! What version are you using? Different models fail differently - but they all fail eventually."
- **Avoid:** Don't rush through the reveal - the impact is in the pause

### Advanced Delivery Options

**If you're feeling bold (Steve Jobs would do this):**

After revealing the AI says 2, pause and say:

"Actually, let me show you. Someone connect to the screen?"

**[Have audience member AirPlay/share screen and ask ChatGPT the question live]**

This is high-risk (what if it gets it right that day?) but incredibly high-impact if it fails. Only do this if you've tested recently and know it's likely to fail, or if you're comfortable improvising if it succeeds ("Well, they fixed that one! But try asking [backup example]...").

**Backup examples if strawberry gets fixed:**
- "How many times does the letter 'f' appear in 'fluffiness'?" (AI often miscounts)
- "If you have 3 apples and buy 2 more, then give away 4, how many do you have left?" (Simple math AI sometimes overthinks)

## SLIDE 14: So What

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Checklist with title
- **Background:** Clean white with subtle gradient
- **Title:** "Always Verify Output" (bold, 60pt, top of slide)
- **Content:** Three checklist items (each 42pt, dark gray text)

**Checklist items (appear sequentially with build animation):**

✓ **Does this make sense?**
  ↳ (Smaller text below, 32pt, light gray): "Trust your domain expertise"

✓ **Can I verify key facts?**
  ↳ "Check sources, test claims"

✓ **What if this is wrong?**
  ↳ "Consider consequences before shipping"

**Animation:**
- Click 1: First item appears (0.4s fade-in)
- Click 2: Second item appears (0.4s fade-in)
- Click 3: Third item appears (0.4s fade-in)

### Speaker Script

**[Slide advances, title visible]**

"So what do you do about this?"

**[Pause, direct gaze at audience]**

"Three questions. Every single time you use AI output."

**[Click - first item appears]**

**[Point at screen]**

"One: Does this make sense?"

**[Look at audience]**

"You know your domain. You know your business. If AI tells you something that feels off, **trust your gut**."

**[Brief pause]**

"The AI doesn't have your context. You do."

**[Click - second item appears]**

"Two: Can I verify key facts?"

**[Gesture with hands - counting off]**

"Statistics. Dates. Names. Quotes. If it matters, look it up."

**[More emphasis]**

"Don't just spot-check. Actually verify."

**[Pause]**

"AI summaries are never exact quotes, even when they look like quotes."

**[Click - third item appears]**

**[Serious tone]**

"Three - and this is the most important one..."

**[Lean in slightly]**

"What if this is wrong?"

**[Let it hang for a beat]**

"If you're drafting an internal email and AI hallucinates something, you look silly. Annoying, but survivable."

**[Shift tone - more grave]**

"If you're presenting to the board, or emailing a customer, or making a strategic decision based on AI output..."

**[Pause]**

"...and it's confidently wrong..."

**[Shake head slightly]**

"That's not a productivity tool anymore. That's a liability."

**[Pause, soften tone]**

"Look - AI is incredibly useful. I use it every day."

**[Gesture to checklist]**

"But I run through this checklist every single time before I ship anything."

**[Direct, confident]**

"Trust, but verify. Every. Single. Time."

**[Pause 2 seconds]**

**[Transition tone - lighter, moving forward]**

"Okay, next myth..."

**[Click to next slide]**

---

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 90-110 seconds
- **Key pauses:**
  - After "What if this is wrong?": 2 seconds (let gravity of question sink in)
  - After "That's a liability": 2 seconds (contrast with "productivity tool")
  - After "Every. Single. Time.": 2 seconds (final emphasis before moving on)

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone journey:** Instructional → cautionary → resolute
- **Emphasis patterns:**
  - Stress "Every. Single. Time." with staccato rhythm
  - Contrast "silly" vs "liability" with vocal tone
  - "Trust your gut" - make it permission-giving
- **Physicality:**
  - Open gestures when listing items (welcoming)
  - Closed/serious posture when discussing liability
  - Return to open on "I use it every day" (credibility through admission)
- **Avoid:**
  - Don't sound preachy - sound practical
  - Don't end on fear note - end on "I do this too, you should too"

## Section Wrap-Up: Transition to Next Myth

**Energy Check:** By end of this section, audience should:
- ✓ Remember the strawberry test (concrete, memorable)
- ✓ Feel slightly more skeptical of AI confidence
- ✓ Have actionable verification checklist
- ✓ Not feel scared of AI, just appropriately cautious

**Transition Strategy:**
After Slide 14, the next myth should shift energy slightly - we've just been serious about verification, so the next myth can afford to be slightly lighter in tone while still educational.

## Adaptation Notes

### For Different Audiences

**If presenting to highly technical audience:**
- Add after strawberry reveal: "This is because of tokenization - AI doesn't see 'strawberry' as letters, it sees it as tokens, subword units. It's not equipped to count characters within tokens."
- Technical folks appreciate the mechanism, not just the demonstration

**If presenting to risk-averse executives:**
- Emphasize the board/customer examples more heavily
- Add specific ROI stat: "One undetected hallucination in a client proposal can cost you a deal. How many hours of AI productivity gains does that erase?"

**If presenting to AI skeptics:**
- After strawberry test, acknowledge: "I know some of you are thinking 'See? I knew AI was overhyped.' And you're partially right. But..."
- Then pivot to "The executives getting value from AI aren't the ones who trust it blindly OR reject it entirely. They're the ones who verify."

**If time is short (3-minute version):**
- Slide 12: 20 seconds
- Slide 13: 60 seconds (cut the extended discussion, just demo)
- Slide 14: 40 seconds (present checklist without elaboration)

**If time is generous (8-minute version):**
- Add live demonstration (have audience member test on their phone)
- Add second example of hallucination (legal case story from Chapter 4)
- Add interactive moment: "Raise your hand if you've ever had AI confidently give you wrong information" (builds community)

## Rehearsal Notes

### Practice Points:
1. **Timing the pause after "AI says: 2"** - this is the money moment. Too short and it doesn't land. Too long and energy drops. Sweet spot is usually 5-7 seconds.

2. **The "Every. Single. Time." rhythm** - practice the staccato emphasis. It should feel like three distinct beats, not one phrase.

3. **Tone transition from strawberry to serious** - practice going from amused/demonstrative to grave/cautionary without being jarring

### Technical Rehearsal:
- Test slide builds/animations on actual presentation system
- Verify strawberry R's are visible from back of room (bring someone to check)
- Have backup slides in case animation fails (static versions)
- Test clicker/remote advance reliability

### Contingency Plans:
- **If projector fails during strawberry slide:** "Okay, everyone imagine the word strawberry in your head. Count the R's. Got it? Now ask ChatGPT on your phone..." (can work as pure verbal)
- **If audience isn't reacting to strawberry reveal:** "I know, it's wild, right? This isn't a trick - you can verify this yourself right now."
- **If someone argues strawberry varies by model:** "Great point! Different models fail differently. The takeaway isn't 'this specific failure,' it's 'AI fails at tasks it seems like it should handle.' Next example..."

---

## Post-Presentation Engagement

**If Q&A includes strawberry test:**
- Common question: "Has this been fixed?"
  - Answer: "Some models have patched this specific example. But new examples emerge constantly. The pattern remains: AI struggles with precision tasks that require step-by-step reasoning."

**If someone tests live and gets different result:**
- "Interesting! Which model and version? [listen] Great data point. The specific example might vary, but the principle holds: we need to verify, because we can't tell from confidence alone whether it's right."

**Social media moment:**
This section is highly shareable. After presentation:
- Post the strawberry slide with caption: "AI is amazing. AI also fails to count to 3. Use accordingly."
- Encourage attendees to try it and share results
- Creates viral moment that reinforces your credibility
