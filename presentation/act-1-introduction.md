- **Energy:** Start quiet, build to "let's cut through"

"Five myths. Five realities."

**[Shift to preview mode]**

"We're going to cover:

What AI actually is - and isn't.

Whether it will replace you - spoiler: it won't.

Why it's confidently wrong so often.

How to actually get useful results.

And why those impressive demos are misleading."

**[Pause]**

**[Direct, setting expectations]**

"By the end, you'll understand:
How to use AI strategically.
Where it helps.
Where it fails.
And what to do Monday morning."

## Act 1 Wrap-Up: Setting the Stage

**Purpose of Act 1:**
- Hook audience with shared experience (confusion)
- Establish problem (hype vs fear)
- Create tension (which is it?)
- Provide resolution path (myth-busting)
- Transition to educational content (myths)

**Energy Arc:**
- Slide 1: Calm, authoritative
- Slide 2: Enthusiastic (hype)
- Slide 3: Serious (fear)
- Slide 4: Quiet, dramatic (question)
- Slide 5: Energetic, solution-oriented (transition)

**Audience State by End:**
- ✓ Engaged (show of hands, shared confusion)
- ✓ Validated (confusion is normal)
- ✓ Curious (what are the myths?)
- ✓ Ready to learn (problem established, solutions promised)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Pacing:** Don't rush Slide 4 - the pause is powerful
- **Authenticity:** Acknowledge real confusion and fear
- **Contrast:** Hype → fear → question creates tension that myths will resolve
- **Momentum:** Slide 5 must launch into content with energy

## Adaptation Notes

### For C-Level Executives
Add after Slide 4:
"And your board is asking: 'What's our AI strategy?' Your team is asking: 'Will this replace us?' You're caught in the middle trying to figure out what's real."

### For Technical Audience
Simplify the hype/fear contrast:
"You've probably seen both the breathless hype and the doom-scrolling. As technical people, you know reality is nuanced. Let's get to that nuance."

### For Skeptical Audience
Acknowledge skepticism early (after Slide 2):
"Some of you are probably thinking 'Yeah, I knew the hype was overblown.' Good. Healthy skepticism helps. But there IS value here - you just need to know where to look."

### For Time-Constrained Version (2-minute intro)
- Slide 1: 20 seconds
- Slides 2-3: Combine into single slide (hype vs fear), 30 seconds
- Slide 4: 40 seconds (keep the pause - this is critical)
- Slide 5: 20 seconds (quick preview, move to myths)

---

## Technical Requirements

### Slide Timing
- Total Act 1 duration: 4-5 minutes
- Critical: Don't rush Slide 4 (the question) - silence is powerful
- Transition from Slide 5 to Myth #1 should be quick (maintain momentum)

### Visual Continuity
- Title slide brain imagery carries through to later slides (circuitry motif)
- Color progression: White (hype) → Dark (fear) → Black (question) → Light (solution)
- Energy progression: Calm → High → Low → Quiet → Energetic

### Audience Management
- Show of hands (Slide 1): Creates participation early
- No questions yet: Save Q&A for end
- If someone tries to interject: "Great question - hold that thought for the Q&A"
