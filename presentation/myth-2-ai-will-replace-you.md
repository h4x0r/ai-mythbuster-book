## SLIDE 9: The Myth

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Full-screen visual with text overlay
- **Background:** Empty office space, desks with no people, tumbleweed rolling by (dramatic but slightly humorous)
- **Color scheme:** Desaturated, slightly dim lighting
- **Text:**
  - Top: "Myth #2" (36pt, white)
  - Center: "Your Job Is Obsolete" (84pt, bold, white)

### Speaker Script

**[Advance to slide]**

"Myth number two."

**[Let visual register - empty office]**

"Your job is obsolete."

**[Pause, serious but empathetic tone]**

"Be honest - how many of you have worried about this?"

**[Wait for hands - most will raise]**

**[Nod, validating]**

"Yeah. You're not alone."

**[Shift tone - slightly lighter]**

"This is the fear underneath all the AI questions, right?"

"'How do I stay relevant?'
'Should I learn to code?'
'What if AI does my job better than me?'"

**[Pause, direct eye contact]**

"I'm going to give you the real answer. And it's more nuanced than the headlines."

**[Click to next slide]**

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 40-50 seconds
- **Key pause:** After "You're not alone" - acknowledge their fear validates it
- **Show of hands:** Most will raise hands - this creates community

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone:** Empathetic, not dismissive
- **Validation:** Their fear is rational - don't minimize it
- **Transition:** "Real answer" signals you're about to reveal something important

## SLIDE 10: The Reality

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Clean, reassuring visual
- **Background:** White/light gray

**Visual:** Airplane cockpit photograph
- Two seats visible: Pilot (left) and Copilot (right)
- Professional, modern aircraft
- Both positions clearly visible and important

**Text:**
- Title: "Reality: AI Is Your Copilot" (60pt, blue, top)
- Subtitle: "Not autopilot. Copilot." (36pt, gray)

### Speaker Script

**[Slide advances to cockpit image]**

"Reality: AI is your copilot."

**[Pause, let visual register]**

"Think about an airplane cockpit."

**[Point to pilot seat]**

"There's a pilot..."

**[Point to copilot seat]**

"...and a copilot."

**[Explain the relationship]**

"The copilot handles routine tasks:
Monitoring systems.
Following the flight plan.
Maintaining altitude."

**[Shift tone - this is the key point]**

"But the pilot is still essential for:
Deciding whether to fly through weather.
Handling emergencies.
Making judgment calls.
**Taking responsibility for safety.**"

**[Direct, clear]**

"The copilot doesn't replace the pilot."

**[Gesture with hands together]**

"The copilot makes the pilot more effective."

**[Pause, let that sink in]**

**[Connect to audience]**

"Same with AI and your work."

**[Enumerate with fingers]**

"AI handles:
First drafts.
Summaries.
Data processing.
Routine responses."

"You handle:
Strategic decisions.
Quality judgment.
Context only you have.
Relationships.
**Responsibility.**"

**[Direct eye contact, matter-of-fact]**

"You're the pilot. AI is the copilot."

**[Slight smile]**

"The copilot doesn't replace the pilot. The copilot makes you more effective at what matters."

**[Click to next slide]**

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 80-90 seconds
- **Key pauses:**
  - After "Copilot makes the pilot more effective": 2-3 seconds
  - After "Same with AI and your work": 2 seconds (bridge moment)
  - After "Responsibility" (both times): 1-2 seconds (emphasis)

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone:** Reassuring, authoritative
- **Analogy:** Spend time on pilot/copilot - this is the mental model they'll remember
- **Repetition:** "Doesn't replace, makes more effective" - say it twice (pilot, then you)
- **Physicality:** Point at visual, use hands to show partnership

## SLIDE 11: So What

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Simple bar chart or comparison
- **Background:** White/light gray
- **Title:** "2-3x in Specific Tasks" (60pt, bold, blue, top)

**Visual:** Horizontal bar chart showing realistic productivity gains

**Three categories:**
1. **Email drafting:** 5-10x faster
   (bar extends far right)

2. **Document summarization:** 8-12x faster
   (bar extends far right)

3. **Overall job productivity:** 2-3x
   (bar extends moderately - much shorter than above)

**Visual note:** Use color to show difference:
- Task-specific: Green bars (big gains)
- Overall: Orange bar (modest, realistic gains)

**Subtitle below chart:** "Not 10x. Not magic. Just better."

### Speaker Script

**[Slide advances]**

"So what does this actually mean for your productivity?"

**[Point to task-specific bars]**

"You'll hear claims about '10x productivity.'"

**[Shake head slightly]**

"That's... misleading."

**[Point to first two bars]**

"Can AI draft an email 10x faster? Sure.
Summarize a document 10x faster? Absolutely."

**[Gesture to overall bar]**

"But your entire job isn't emails and summaries."

**[Direct, honest tone]**

"Real productivity gains? **2 to 3x in specific tasks.**"

**[Let that land]**

"Which is still great!"

**[Explain what this means]**

"If you're spending 40 hours a week, and 15 of those hours are AI-augmentable tasks..."

**[Use hands to show math]**

"AI might cut those 15 hours to 5 hours."

**[Show outcome]**

"You save 10 hours per week."

**[Shift tone - empowering]**

"What do you do with those 10 hours?"

**[Enumerate options]**

"More strategic work.
Better decisions - because you have time to think.
Deeper relationships with your team.
Actually taking lunch."

**[Slight smile, pause]**

**[Serious again]**

"Your job doesn't disappear."

**[Emphatic]**

"It expands to higher-value work."

**[Pause, then transition]**

"Next myth..."

**[Click to next slide]**

### Timing Notes
- **Total time on slide:** 70-80 seconds
- **Key pauses:**
  - After "2 to 3x in specific tasks": 2 seconds (reality check moment)
  - After "Which is still great!": 1 second (reframe from disappointment)
  - After "Your job doesn't disappear": 2 seconds (reassurance)

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone journey:** Deflating hype → honest → empowering
- **Math:** Walk through the 15 hours → 5 hours calculation clearly
- **Reframe:** "Still great!" prevents disappointment from realistic numbers
- **Ending:** Empower them - their work becomes MORE valuable, not less

## Section Wrap-Up: Addressing Fear

**Purpose of Myth #2:**
- Addresses elephant in room (job displacement fear)
- Provides historical context (technology changes work, doesn't eliminate it)
- Introduces copilot model (mental framework for AI role)
- Sets realistic expectations (2-3x, not 10x)
- Empowers audience (they remain essential)

**Energy Check:** By end of this section, audience should:
- ✓ Feel less anxious about job displacement
- ✓ Understand copilot model
- ✓ Have realistic productivity expectations
- ✓ Feel more valuable (judgment layer amplified)

**Transition:** Now that job fears are addressed, they're ready to hear about AI limitations (Myth #3 - strawberry test).

## Adaptation Notes

### For Anxious Audience
Add after copilot explanation:
"History shows this pattern every time: spreadsheets didn't eliminate accountants, ATMs didn't eliminate bank tellers, email didn't eliminate admins. Technology automates routine tasks, and workers shift to higher-value work."

### For Executive Audience
Emphasize strategic value:
"The executives who thrive won't be the ones doing routine tasks faster. They'll be the ones using freed-up time for strategy, relationships, and decisions that actually move the business forward."

### For Time-Constrained Version
- Slide 9: 20 seconds
- Slide 10: 45 seconds (just copilot analogy, skip enumeration)
- Slide 11: 30 seconds (show chart, skip detailed math)
