### Speaker Script

**[Slide advances]**

"Okay. Five myths busted."

**[Pause]**

"So what do you actually DO?"

**[Direct, practical]**

"Start here. Tomorrow."

**[Point to each column as you describe]**

**[First column]**

"Summarize."

"Take your next meeting transcript. Feed it to AI. Ask for key decisions, action items, next steps."

**[Specific example]**

"Instead of spending 30 minutes writing meeting notes, spend 5 minutes reviewing AI's summary."

**[Second column]**

"Draft."

"Need to write a status update? Client email? Team announcement?"

"Don't start with a blank page. Start with AI's first draft. Then refine it."

**[Third column]**

"Research."

"Need background on a topic? Industry overview? Competitive landscape?"

"Use AI to get started. Then verify and dive deeper where it matters."

**[Pause, look at audience]**

**[Direct instruction]**

"Pick ONE of these three. Just one."

**[Emphasize]**

"Try it this week."

**[Practical]**

"Measure how much time it saves versus how much time you spend reviewing."

**[Pause]**

"That's your actual productivity gain. Not hype. Real numbers."

**[Transition]**

"Once you've mastered these..."

**[Click to next slide]**

Data analysis - finding patterns in sales data, customer feedback, performance metrics.

Competitive intelligence - synthesizing what competitors are doing, market trends."

**[Direct guidance]**

"Don't start here."

**[Point back toward previous slide direction]**

"Master the basics first. Summarize, draft, research."

**[Forward again]**

"Then expand to these."

**[Pause]**

**[Transition - shift tone, more serious]**

"And here's what you should NEVER do..."

**[Click to next slide]**

---

### Timing Notes

"One hallucination in a client proposal?
One made-up statistic in marketing?
One wrong answer in customer support?"

**[Serious]**

"Damages trust. Takes months to recover."

**[Point to third]**

"Compliance. Legal. Regulatory documents."

**[Matter-of-fact]**

"AI doesn't understand jurisdiction-specific requirements. Errors have real consequences."

**[Pause]**

**[Read bottom note slowly]**

"AI can help."

**[Pause]**

"YOU must own the output."

**[Direct eye contact]**

"Every. Single. Time."

**[Pause, let it land]**

**Subtitle (bottom):**
- "Actual results beat buzzwords." (36pt, gray)

### Speaker Script

**[Slide advances]**

"Measure what matters."

**[Point to left column]**

"Don't measure this."

**[Read with slight mockery]**

"'We adopted AI!' Great. So what?
'500 queries this month!' Were they useful?
'Everyone's using it!' Are they getting value?"

**[Shake head]**

"Vanity metrics. Meaningless."

**[Point to right column]**

"Measure this."

**[Read clearly, with emphasis on numbers]**

"Time saved: 8 hours per week.
Quality maintained at 95%.
Caught 12 errors in review.
Net productivity gain: 2.3x on drafting tasks."

**[Pause]**

"Real numbers. Actual impact."

**[Direct instruction]**

"When you start using AI, track:
How much time did AI save?
How much time did you spend reviewing?
What's the net gain?
Did quality stay the same?"

**[Pause]**

**[Honest]**

"If the numbers don't work? Stop using it for that task. Try something else."

**[Matter-of-fact]**

"Productivity gains are real - but only if you measure them honestly."

**[Pause, shift to closing]**

"Alright."

**[Gesture encompassing whole presentation]**

"You now know:
What AI is.
Where it helps.
Where it fails.
What to try first.
What to avoid.
How to measure results."

**[Pause]**

**[Direct, simple]**

"Go try it."

**[Pause]**

"Questions?"

**[Click to final slide]**

## SLIDE 25: Questions?

### Visual Description
- **Layout:** Minimal, clean
- **Background:** White or very light gray

**Bottom of slide:**
- Your contact information (24pt, gray):
  - Email
  - LinkedIn
  - Twitter/X (optional)
  - Company website (optional)

**Optional additions:**
- QR code (bottom right) linking to:
  - Full book/resources
  - Slide deck download
  - Contact form
  - Newsletter signup

**Alternative design:**
- "Thank you" version if Q&A happens separately
- Keep design clean and uncluttered

### Speaker Script

**[Slide appears]**

**[Pause, open stance]**

"Questions?"

**[Open floor for Q&A]**

---

**[If no immediate questions]**

"Let me start with common ones I get:"

**[Have 2-3 prepared questions ready, such as:]**

**Q: "What's the best AI tool to start with?"**

A: "For most business users? ChatGPT or Claude for text tasks. GitHub Copilot if you code. But honestly? The tool matters less than understanding how to prompt it well. Pick one, master it, then evaluate others."

**Q: "How long until AI CAN do strategic thinking?"**

A: "Unknown. Current AI is pattern completion, not reasoning. Will that change? Possibly. When? Nobody knows despite the confident predictions. For now, plan based on current capabilities, not theoretical future ones."

**Q: "Should we be training everyone on AI?"**

A: "Yes, but start small. Don't mandate it. Show value with pilot projects. Share what works. Training on prompt engineering is valuable, but hands-on practice beats classroom theory."

---

**[Closing if time runs out or no more questions]**

"Alright. I'll stick around after if you have specific questions."

**[Point to contact info]**

"My contact information is here. Email me if you want to continue the conversation."

**[Final thought]**

"Remember: AI is a tool, not magic. Use it strategically, verify the output, measure honestly."

**[Pause]**

"Thank you."

**[End]**

## Common Q&A Topics (Prepare Answers)

### Implementation Questions

**"How do I get my team on board?"**
- Lead by example first
- Share specific wins (time saved, better output)
- Provide templates and training
- Make it optional initially
- Reward good practices

**"What if AI gives different answers to the same question?"**
- That's expected - it's probabilistic
- Use constraints in prompts for consistency
- Create templates for recurring tasks
- Document what works

**"How do I choose between AI tools?"**
- Start with general tools (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Evaluate specialized tools once you understand use cases
- Consider: ease of use, security, pricing, integration
- Trial before committing

---

### Concern Questions

**"What about security and data privacy?"**
- Don't feed sensitive data to public AI tools
- Use enterprise versions with data controls
- Check your company's AI usage policy
- When in doubt, anonymize data

**"What if I become dependent on AI and it goes away?"**
- You're learning augmented workflows, not replacing skills
- Core skills (judgment, communication) remain yours
- AI is tool, not crutch
- Treat it like spreadsheets - useful but not mission-critical

**"Isn't AI going to keep getting better and replace more jobs?"**
- Capabilities will improve - plan for that
- Focus on areas AI struggles (judgment, relationships, creativity)
- Augmentation model holds even as AI improves
- Adapt continuously, don't ignore changes

---

### Technical Questions

**"Can AI work with our internal systems?"**
- Depends on tools and setup
- Enterprise AI can integrate via APIs
- RAG approaches let you feed internal documents
- Consult IT for specific integration options

**"How do we ensure compliance when using AI?"**
- Have legal review policies
- Use enterprise tools with audit logs
- Train on what NOT to use AI for
- Regular compliance audits

---

## Adaptation Notes

### For Virtual/Hybrid Presentations

**Adjust Q&A approach:**
- Monitor chat for questions
- Call on raised hands (virtual)
- Use polling for engagement
- Repeat all questions aloud

### For Workshop Format (More Time)

**Add after Slide 21:**
- 10-minute hands-on exercise
- Everyone tries one Tier 1 task
- Share results in pairs
- Discuss what worked/didn't

### For Conference Format (Less Time)

**Compress Act 3:**
- Combine Slides 21-22 into one (here's what to try)
- Keep Slide 23 (never do this - critical)
- Skip Slide 24 (measurement) if time-constrained
- Keep Slide 25 (questions - but shorter)
