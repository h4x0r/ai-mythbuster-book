## Steve Jobs Style Principles

### Slide Design
1. **One idea per slide** - never more
2. **Minimal text** - largest font possible
3. **Powerful visuals** - support, not decorate
4. **High contrast** - readable from back of room
5. **No bullet builds** - outdated and distracting

### Delivery Principles
1. **Rule of three** - never more than 3 points
2. **Pause for effect** - silence is powerful
3. **Stories over statistics** - humans remember narratives
4. **Reveal moments** - save impact for strategic moments
5. **"One more thing..."** - save something for the end

### Energy Management
- **Act 1:** Build tension (hype vs fear)
- **Act 2:** Educational but engaging (vary pacing)
- **Act 3:** Empowering and actionable (send them off ready)

---

## Visual Guidelines

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Deep blue (#1E3A8A) - trust, professionalism
- **Accent:** Electric orange (#FF6B35) - energy, warning
- **Success:** Green (#00AA00) - correctness, action
- **Error:** Red (#FF4444) - mistakes, danger
- **Background:** White or very light gray (#F9FAFB)
- **Text:** Charcoal gray (#374151) - easier than pure black

### Typography
- **Headers:** Bold sans-serif, 60pt minimum
- **Body:** Sans-serif, 36pt minimum
- **Sub-text:** 32pt minimum
- **Rule:** Readable from 10 feet away from laptop

### Image Style
- **Quality:** High-res (1920x1080 minimum)
- **Style:** Professional stock or custom illustrations
- **Avoid:** Clipart, busy backgrounds, decorative clutter
- **Icons:** Simple, flat design, consistent style

### Animation Guidelines
- **Use sparingly:** Only when reveal enhances understanding
- **Strategic builds:**
  - Slide 13 (strawberry): Progressive reveal for impact
  - Slide 14 (checklist): Sequential for memorization
  - Slide 19 (iceberg): Reveal underwater portion dramatically
- **Avoid:**
  - Slide transitions (distracting)
  - Bullet point builds (dated)
  - Spinning/flying text (unprofessional)
