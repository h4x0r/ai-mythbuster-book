# Chapter 7: Myth - "Just Prompt and Go" / Reality - "Engineering Good Results"

## The Magical Thinking Problem

You've seen the demos.

Someone types "Write a marketing plan" into ChatGPT, and out pops a beautiful, comprehensive strategy document. They click "generate," ship it, and move on.

Looks easy, right?

So you try it yourself.

You type "Write a marketing plan" and you get... something.

It's not terrible. But it's also not useful.

It's generic. Vague. Missing your specific context. Sounds like it was written by someone who's never worked in your industry.

Which, technically, it wasn't. It was generated by pattern-matching thousands of marketing plans with no understanding of your business.

**You wonder: What am I doing wrong?**

The answer: **You're expecting AI to read your mind.**

## The Skeleton Principle (Redux)

Remember from [Chapter 2](#chapter2): AI completes patterns.

It doesn't reason about what you actually need. It predicts what usually comes next based on similar patterns.

When you say "Write a marketing plan," AI has to guess:
- The type of product or service
- The industry and market
- The stage (launch, growth, mature)
- The goals (awareness, leads, revenue)
- The format (one-page, comprehensive, executive summary)
- The audience (board, team, external partners)

Without this context, AI picks the most common pattern: Generic Marketing Plan Template #4,392.

**Here's the fix:** Don't ask AI to figure out what you want. Tell it exactly what you want.

This is called prompt engineering, and it's not magic.

It's being specific.

## Garbage In, Garbage Out

Let me show you the difference between a weak prompt and a strong prompt:

### Weak Prompt (What Most People Type)

> "Write a marketing plan"

### What AI Gets From This

Nothing:
- No product context
- No target audience
- No goals or metrics
- No timeline
- No constraints

AI defaults to whatever's most common in training data.

You get a five-page generic template that could apply to any product:
- Sections on "target market" that don't identify your actual market
- "Marketing channels" that list every channel without prioritization
- No actionable insights

**Time saved:** 0 minutes (because you can't use it)

**Time wasted:** 5 minutes reading unusable output

---

### Strong Prompt (What Works)

> "Write a one-page marketing plan for a B2B SaaS project management tool targeting teams of 10-50 people. Focus on the next quarter. Include:
> - Target customer profile (specific)
> - Top 3 channels for customer acquisition
> - Key message positioning vs competitors
> - Success metrics (specific numbers)
> - Budget estimate
>
> Our unique differentiator is AI-powered project risk prediction. Main competitors are Asana and Monday.com. Our goal is 500 new trial signups in Q1.
>
> Format: Executive summary style, bullet points, suitable for board presentation."

### What AI Gets From This

Everything it needs:
- Specific product and market
- Clear scope and timeline
- Explicit sections to include
- Competitive context
- Measurable goals
- Format requirements
- Audience context

### What You Get

A usable first draft that includes your specific context.

You'll still need to review and refine. But you've got 70% of the work done in 30 seconds instead of starting from scratch.

**Time saved:** 40 minutes (draft generation vs blank page)

**Quality:** Good enough to refine vs having to completely rewrite

---

**The difference:** Specificity. Structure. Context.

This is the skeleton principle in action: The better the skeleton you provide, the better AI completes it.

---

**Real-World Example: The Google Search Evolution**

Remember the early 2000s when Google search was pure keyword matching?

You'd type: "cheap hotels seattle"

And you'd get a mess of results - some about cheap things in Seattle, some about hotels elsewhere, some about Seattle's hotel industry. You'd spend 20 minutes clicking through pages trying to find what you actually wanted.

Users had to learn "Google-speak":
- Use quotes for exact phrases
- Add minus signs to exclude words
- String together keywords in just the right order
- Know the difference between "seattle hotels cheap" and "cheap seattle hotels"

It was a skill. People got good at it. SEO experts made careers optimizing for keyword matching.

Fast forward to today. You type:

"Where should I stay in Seattle for under $150/night near Pike Place Market with parking?"

And you get exactly what you want. Natural language. Specific requirements. Clear intent.

What changed? Google got better at understanding vague queries, yes. But more importantly, users learned that specific input gets useful results while vague input gets vague results.

The learning curve took years.

Now we're facing the same learning curve with AI prompts.

"Write a marketing plan" is the 2025 equivalent of "cheap hotels seattle."

Vague. Ambiguous. Requires the system to guess what you mean.

"Write a one-page marketing plan for a B2B SaaS project management tool targeting teams of 10-50 people, focusing on Q1, with specific sections on customer profile, top 3 channels, positioning vs Asana and Monday.com, and success metrics for 500 trial signups" is the equivalent of the specific modern search.

The AI hasn't fundamentally changed how it works (pattern completion). You've changed how you communicate with it.

Just like Google search, the executives who master AI are the ones who learned that specificity beats vagueness.

The good news: you don't need years to learn this. Just the willingness to be specific about what you want.

## The Five Elements of Strong Prompts

After testing hundreds of prompts, I've found five elements that consistently improve AI output:

### 1. Context (What's the Situation?)

**Weak:** "Summarize this"

**Strong:** "Summarize this 50-page technical report for non-technical stakeholders. Focus on business implications, not technical details."

**Why it matters:** AI doesn't know who the audience is or what matters to them. You do.

### 2. Format (What Shape Should the Output Take?)

**Weak:** "Explain our pricing"

**Strong:** "Explain our pricing in a table with three columns: Plan Name, Price, Key Features. Max 5 rows."

**Why it matters:** AI will default to prose unless you specify otherwise. Specific formats (table, bullets, numbered list) get better results.

### 3. Constraints (What Are the Boundaries?)

**Weak:** "Write an email to the team"

**Strong:** "Write a 3-paragraph email to the team. Max 150 words. Professional but friendly tone. Include: project update, timeline change, next steps."

**Why it matters:** Without constraints, AI will optimize for completeness (long) rather than conciseness (useful).

### 4. Examples (What Does Good Look Like?)

**Weak:** "Generate product taglines"

**Strong:** "Generate product taglines similar to these examples: 'Just Do It' (Nike), 'Think Different' (Apple). Keep to 2-4 words, memorable, action-oriented."

**Why it matters:** AI learns better from examples than from abstract descriptions of quality.

### 5. Success Criteria (How Will I Know It's Right?)

**Weak:** "Analyze this data"

**Strong:** "Analyze this sales data. I need to know: (1) Which products are growing fastest? (2) Which regions are underperforming? (3) What should we prioritize next quarter? Give specific numbers."

**Why it matters:** AI needs to know what "done" looks like. Specific questions get specific answers.

## Common Prompt Failures (and Fixes)

### Failure #1: The Vague Ask

**Bad prompt:** "Help me with customer feedback"

**What you get:** Generic advice about how to collect customer feedback

**Why it fails:** AI doesn't know if you want to collect, analyze, respond to, or report on feedback

**Fix:** "Analyze these 50 customer feedback responses. Identify the top 3 recurring complaints and the top 3 most requested features. Present as a summary table."

---

### Failure #2: The Assumed Context

**Bad prompt:** "Write a response to the client"

**What you get:** Generic professional email template

**Why it fails:** AI has no idea what client, what situation, what the message should convey

**Fix:** "Write a response to the client explaining why we missed the deadline. Apologize professionally, explain the technical issue (server outage), propose new timeline (1 week extension), and offer a 10% discount as goodwill. Tone: apologetic but confident. Max 2 paragraphs."

---

### Failure #3: The Impossible Task

**Bad prompt:** "Tell me the exact ROI we'll get from this marketing campaign"

**What you get:** Made-up numbers based on industry averages

**Why it fails:** AI cannot predict the future or access your specific business data

**Fix:** "Based on these assumptions [provide data], estimate potential ROI range for this campaign. Show your calculation. Flag which assumptions are most uncertain."

---

### Failure #4: The Missing Format

**Bad prompt:** "Give me competitive analysis"

**What you get:** Long essay-format analysis

**Why it fails:** You probably wanted a comparison table, but AI defaulted to prose

**Fix:** "Create a competitive analysis comparing our product vs competitors A, B, C. Format as a table: Features (rows) vs Competitors (columns). Use checkmarks for 'has feature' and X for 'missing feature'."

---

### Failure #5: The One-Shot Expectation

**Bad prompt:** [Complex request with multiple parts, expecting perfect output on first try]

**What you get:** Misses some nuances, gets some parts right

**Why it fails:** Complex tasks require iteration. AI isn't perfect first try.

**Fix:** Treat AI as a conversation. Start with big picture, then iterate:

1. "Draft outline for this report"
2. [Review outline] "Expand section 3 with more detail on risks"
3. [Review expansion] "Add specific metrics to the risk section"
4. [Review metrics] "Format this as a table"

## Overcoming AI Limitations Through Structure

Remember from [Chapter 5](#chapter5): AI hallucinates, especially on precision tasks.

Here's how to work around those limitations:

### Limitation: AI Can't Count or Calculate Reliably

**Don't ask AI:** "How many R's are in strawberry?"

**Instead:** "Write a Python script that counts how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word 'strawberry'. Include the code and the output."

AI writes the script (it's good at code). The script does the counting (it's good at precision). Problem solved.

**Principle:** Use AI to create tools that solve precision problems. Don't ask AI to solve precision problems directly.

---

### Limitation: AI Doesn't Know Your Internal Information

**Don't ask AI:** "What's our company's policy on remote work?"

**Instead:** "Here's our remote work policy document: [paste it]. Summarize the key rules in bullet points for new hires."

This is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). You provide the source material. AI summarizes it.

**Principle:** Feed AI the information it needs. Don't expect it to know company-specific details.

---

### Limitation: AI Makes Up Facts Confidently

**Don't ask AI:** "What were our Q3 sales numbers?"

**Instead:** "Here are our Q3 sales numbers: [paste data]. Create a visual table showing month-over-month growth rates."

You provide facts. AI formats them.

**Principle:** Human provides facts. AI provides formatting and structure.

---

### Limitation: AI Struggles With Multi-Step Logic

**Don't ask AI:** [One massive prompt with 10 interdependent steps]

**Instead:** Break into steps:
- AI does step 1
- You verify and provide output to step 2
- AI does step 2
- You verify and provide output to step 3
- Continue this pattern

**Principle:** Human-in-the-loop for complex reasoning. AI handles individual steps. You verify logic between steps.

## The Right Tool for the Job

Not all AI tools are created equal.

Using general-purpose AI for specialized tasks is like using a Swiss Army knife for surgery. Technically it has a blade. But you want the right tool.

### General-Purpose AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

Good for:
- Drafting and editing text
- Summarizing documents
- Brainstorming ideas
- General research
- Format conversion

Not suitable for:
- Mission-critical code (will work but might have subtle bugs)
- Legal or compliance documents (hallucination risk too high)
- Financial calculations (use spreadsheets)
- Highly specialized domains (use purpose-built tools)

---

### Purpose-Built AI Tools

Different tools for different jobs.

**Code generation and review:**

Specialized AI tools exist for different coding workflows. Some emphasize generation speed, others emphasize code safety and review quality. Have your engineering team evaluate options based on your quality requirements and risk tolerance.

**Data analysis:**
- General AI can describe trends but might hallucinate statistics
- Spreadsheet tools with AI plugins: let AI suggest formulas while spreadsheet calculates (precision preserved)
- Purpose-built analytics tools: use AI to identify patterns validated by statistical methods

**Content creation:**
- General AI: good for first drafts and general content
- Marketing-focused AI tools: optimized for conversion copy (trained on high-performing examples)
- AI editing tools: focus on improving existing content, not generating from scratch (different use case)

**Principle:** Match the tool to the task. General AI for general tasks. Specialized AI for high-stakes or domain-specific work.

## The Human-in-the-Loop Mandate

Here's the rule that will save you from expensive mistakes:

**NEVER ship AI output without human review.**

I'll say it louder for the people in the back:

**NEVER. SHIP. AI. OUTPUT. WITHOUT. HUMAN. REVIEW.**

Doesn't matter how good the prompt was.

Doesn't matter how clean the output looks.

Doesn't matter if you're in a hurry.

Review. Every. Time.

### What "Review" Actually Means

Not a quick skim. Actual review:

**1. Does this make logical sense?**

Trust your domain expertise. If something feels off, it probably is.

AI doesn't have your context or judgment.

**2. Are the facts accurate?**

Verify statistics against sources. Check names, dates, numbers. Confirm quotes are real (AI paraphrases).

**3. Is the tone appropriate?**

AI defaults to generic professional. You know your audience better.

Adjust for relationship, context, culture.

**4. What if this is wrong?**

Consider consequences of errors. Higher stakes require more thorough review.

Customer-facing? Board presentation? Legal document? Verify everything.

**5. Would I defend this if questioned?**

If you wouldn't put your name on it, don't ship it.

AI is your tool, not your scapegoat. You're accountable for the output.

### The Time Equation

Some people skip review because "it takes too long."

Let's do the math.

**Scenario: Drafting a project proposal**

**Option A: Write it yourself**
- Time: 2 hours
- Quality: High (you know the project)
- Risk: Low (you caught errors as you wrote)

**Option B: AI generates, you ship without review**
- Time: 5 minutes
- Quality: Unknown (might be great, might be garbage)
- Risk: HIGH (hallucinations, wrong tone, missing context)

**Option C: AI generates, you review and refine**
- Time: 30 minutes (5 min generation + 25 min review and editing)
- Quality: High (AI draft + your expertise)
- Risk: Low (you caught errors in review)

**Option C is the winner: 75% time savings, high quality, low risk.**

The review isn't wasting time.

The review is what makes AI useful.

### Cross-Model Verification: A Triage Technique

Here's a practical trick: use a different AI model to review the first model's output.

Ask Claude to critique ChatGPT's draft. Ask Gemini to fact-check Claude's claims. Different models have different training data and biases, so they catch different errors.

**When this helps:**

- Disagreement between models flags issues for investigation
- One model may catch hallucinations the other missed
- Low-effort additional layer before deeper review

**When this fails:**

- Models can share similar training data and make the same mistakes
- Agreement doesn't mean accuracy (both are pattern-matching, not fact-checking)
- Neither may catch domain-specific nuances you'd catch instantly

**The right framing:**

Cross-model verification is a triage filter, not validation.

- Models agree &rarr; Still verify manually
- Models disagree &rarr; Definitely verify manually

Think of it as a smoke detector, not a fire inspector. It alerts you to potential problems. It doesn't certify the building is safe.

This technique supplements human review. It never replaces it.

## Building Your Prompt Library

One of the best productivity hacks: Build a library of proven prompts for your common tasks.

### How to Build It

**Step 1: Identify recurring tasks.**

Look for:
- Weekly status updates
- Client proposals
- Meeting summaries
- Data analysis requests
- Email responses

**Step 2: Develop a strong prompt for each.**

Include all five elements:
- Context
- Format
- Constraints
- Examples
- Success criteria

Test and refine until output is consistently good. Save the working prompt as a template.

**Step 3: Create fill-in-the-blank templates.**

Here's an example template:

    Summarize this [MEETING TYPE] meeting for [AUDIENCE]. Focus on [KEY TOPICS].

    Include:
    - Decisions made (bullet points)
    - Action items with owners
    - Open questions
    - Next steps

    Format: [FORMAT]
    Tone: [TONE]
    Max length: [LENGTH]

When you need it, just fill in the brackets and paste.

**Step 4: Share with your team.**

Create a shared document of proven prompts:
- Standardize output quality across team
- Onboard new team members faster

## Monday Morning Action Plan

This week, engineer better prompts:

### Experiment 1: The Before/After Test (30 minutes)

Pick a task you've tried with AI before that gave mediocre results.

**Step 1:** Use your original weak prompt. Save the output.

**Step 2:** Rewrite the prompt with all five elements:
- Context (situation and audience)
- Format (specific structure)
- Constraints (boundaries and limits)
- Examples (what good looks like)
- Success criteria (how you'll know it's right)

**Step 3:** Compare outputs. Measure improvement.

**Goal:** See the impact of prompt engineering firsthand.

---

### Experiment 2: Build Your First Template (45 minutes)

Identify your most frequent AI task (status updates, summaries, emails, whatever).

Create a fill-in-the-blank prompt template:
- Include all five elements
- Mark what changes each time with brackets
- Test it three times with real examples
- Refine until consistently good
- Save it somewhere accessible

**Goal:** Reusable prompt that saves time every time you use it.

---

### Experiment 3: The Right Tool Test (20 minutes)

Pick one task where you've been using general-purpose AI.

Research whether there's a purpose-built tool for this:
- For code: try specialized coding AI tools
- For marketing copy: try specialized tools
- For data analysis: try AI-enhanced analytics platforms

Try the specialized tool. Compare quality and time vs general AI.

**Goal:** Understand when specialized tools beat general AI.

---

### Experiment 4: The Review Checklist (Ongoing)

Create your personal AI output review checklist:

- □ Logical sense check
- □ Facts verified
- □ Tone appropriate
- □ [Add your domain-specific checks]

Print it. Put it next to your monitor. Use it every time.

**Goal:** Never ship unreviewed AI output again.

## The Bottom Line

"Just prompt and go" is magical thinking.

Real productivity comes from:
- Writing specific, structured prompts (prompt engineering)
- Using the right tool for the job (general vs specialized)
- Reviewing output before shipping (human-in-the-loop)
- Building reusable templates (efficiency over time)

The executives getting 2-3x productivity from AI aren't lucky.

They're not AI whisperers with secret knowledge.

They're just being specific about what they want and verifying what they get.

Prompt engineering isn't magic.

It's communication. You're communicating clearly with a tool that predicts patterns.

The better your communication, the better the results.

In the next chapter, we'll tackle the seductive danger of "vibe coding": the gap between impressive demos and production-ready systems.

---

**Chapter Summary:**

Weak prompts get weak results (garbage in, garbage out). Strong prompts include context, format, constraints, examples, and success criteria. Use AI to create precision tools (scripts) rather than doing precision tasks directly. RAG (feed AI your documents) overcomes hallucination on company-specific info. Match tool to task: general AI for general work, specialized AI for specialized work. Always review AI output before shipping (no exceptions). Build a prompt library for recurring tasks (reusable efficiency).
