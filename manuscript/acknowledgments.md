# Acknowledgments

**In memory of Professor Samuel T. Chanson** - you taught me that the most valuable skill in technology isn't chasing trends, it's recognizing which patterns persist beneath them. Your influence lives on in these pages, and in every conversation where I choose clarity over comfort.

**To Andrea,** for believing in me to this day, even when that belief required more patience than seemed reasonable. Thank you.

This book exists because dozens of executives asked me the same questions about AI, then actually listened when I gave them honest answers instead of hype. Thank you for being willing to hear "it's complicated" instead of demanding simple certainty.

**To the UC Berkeley Alumni AI Group** - you kept me honest by showing me what's actually possible at the frontier. While I was warning executives about hype, you were building real systems that pushed boundaries I didn't know existed. That tension between skepticism and possibility? You're the reason this book has both.

To the colleagues and clients who reviewed drafts, challenged assumptions, and shared their own expensive AI lessons - your honesty made this better. Special thanks to those who admitted their mistakes publicly so others could learn privately.

Finally, to the readers: If this book saves you from one expensive AI mistake or helps you spot one genuine opportunity, it's done its job. The goal isn't to make you an AI expert - it's to make you strategically competent with a confusing tool. If you got that, we both succeeded.
