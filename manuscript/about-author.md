# About the Author

Albert Hui is a Cyber Security Advisor at the Institute of Directors, former Risk Advisory Director at Deloitte, and former IBM Global Security Architect. Across thirty years in technology, he's developed a reputation for one thing: spotting the constants within change and the patterns within chaos.

At IBM - a company that's been working with AI since the 1950s, long before it became a boardroom buzzword - Albert learned to distinguish genuine technological shifts from hype cycles. That perspective proved invaluable in subsequent roles advising enterprises on risk, security, and strategic technology adoption.

When generative AI exploded into public consciousness, Albert found himself in a familiar position: navigating between extremes. Conservatives who wanted to resist change entirely. Reckless adopters who wanted to deploy AI without understanding limitations. Executives caught in the middle, trying to separate signal from noise.

The conversations became repetitive. The questions predictable. The mistakes expensive and avoidable.

This book is Albert's answer to that repetition - a distillation of three decades of pattern recognition, applied to the most hyped and misunderstood technology shift in recent memory. It's not a prediction of AI's future. It's a field guide for navigating AI's messy, confusing present.

Albert believes AI is neither miracle nor apocalypse. It's a powerful tool that requires skill to use well and honesty to assess clearly. This book reflects that philosophy: no hype, no panic, just pragmatic guidance for people trying to make informed decisions.

He's based in London, where he continues to advise organizations on technology risk and strategic adoption. When he's not explaining AI to skeptics or warning enthusiasts, he's usually savouring whisky (single malt, cask strength).
